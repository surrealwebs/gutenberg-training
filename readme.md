## Description ##

**Scaffolding**

Use the [`init-plugin.sh`](init-plugin.sh) bash script to scaffold a new plugin. The script will enter an interactive shell on your host machine and copy this plugin while making necessary string replacements:

```bash
./init-plugin.sh
```

The `init-plugin.sh` script will be removed from the generated plugin. You should also update your `readme.txt` and add/change any of the config files your project may need, read more about your options in the [`xwp/wp-dev-lib/readme.md`](https://github.com/xwp/wp-dev-lib) file.

**Coveralls Pro**

To use Coveralls Pro with your private repository you will need to change the `service_name` inside `.coveralls.yml` to `travis-pro`, and add the `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` to the settings in Travis CI. If you don't want to use Coveralls then you will need to delete the `.coveralls.yml` and remove `npm run test:js:coveralls` step from the script section in the `.travis.yml` file.

**Adding Classes**

When adding a new class you should instantiate it in `Plugin::init` and inject `Plugin` as a dependency. There is a `Sample` class inside the `php` directory that demonstrates this behavior and how doc hooks work.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
